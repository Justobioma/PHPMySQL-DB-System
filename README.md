# PHPMySQL-DB-System
This is a database system built on PHP, MySql and Apache and based on the CRUD principle.
The program is for an arbritrary membership club that collects such details as names, title, status, email and physical addresses of its patrons.
As at now, it crashes when I add the phone bit to it. I am still checking to see what the issue it.
Also the update and delete functions are yet to be functional. These will be sorted out soon too.
So hopefully the next update should take care of these issues.
